# Evamp & Saanga - GenAI Customer Service Agent

### Project Overview:
The **E&S GenAI Customer Service Agent** is an AI-powered assistant chatbot designed to provide personalized customer service by utilizing tailored responses to consumer queries and enhanced customer interactions. This agent integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide **personalized, context-aware responses** based on customer data, past interactions, and domain knowledge.

**Features:**

- **LLM Integration**: Uses the `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` open source large language model (LLM) to generate intelligent, human-like responses.
- **Personalized Query Handling**: Processes customer queries based on provided data and domain knowledge.
- **RAG Workflow**: Enhances response accuracy by retrieving relevant external knowledge.
